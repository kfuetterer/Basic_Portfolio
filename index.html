	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<h2>Connect with Me</h2>

	<p>My name is Katharina Fuetterer and I am a graduate from Savannah College of Art and Design in Industrial Design. I have a passion for design and problem solving. Therefore I am currently pursuing further education through Georgia Tech to become a full-stack web developer so I can use both my design expertise and my problem solving strategies.</p>
